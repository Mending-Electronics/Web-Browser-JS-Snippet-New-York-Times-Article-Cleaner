2. **Customizable Themes**: It adds a button that lets you toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable reading.

4. **Text Size**: It adds a range slider to allow you to adjust the text size as desired. 

5. **Note Area**: It adds a button that lets you toggle between adding or removing empty areas below each paragraph to take notes. 

6. **Translate**: It includes the Google Translate service in the webpage to translate the article. 

7. **Audio Isolation**: If the New York Times provides an audio reader, the snippet isolates the article audio, allowing you to adjust sound levels and download it as an MP3.

*(Tip: Save the article in two PDF files, first in English (US) and the second in your native language to compare.)* 

  

## What Is a Snippet? 

A **snippet** is a script embedded into your web browser that can be executed on demand to interact with the current page. In the case of our JavaScript snippet, it's written in ES5 (ECMAScript 5) and allows you to manipulate the content of the New York Times article dynamically.
